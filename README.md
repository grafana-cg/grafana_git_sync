# grafana_git_sync

Git Sync in Grafana lets you manage your dashboards as code as JSON files stored in GitHub. You and your team can version control, collaborate, and automate deployments efficiently.

Using Git Sync, you can:

Manage dashboard configuration outside of Grafana instances using Git
Introduce a review process for creating and modifying dashboards
Replicate dashboards across multiple instances
